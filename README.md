*The World was destroyed, nuclear winter came and dead people are back on earth to eat some fresh brains.*

*You and a bunch of other survivors have to escape and go ahead to find some better places.
Take control of your spaceship and try to go as far as you can.*

*Warning! this game is very addictive and is definitely not relaxing, you've been warned.*
